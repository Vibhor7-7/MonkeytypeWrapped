## 📊 Stats Calculated using Numpy/Pandas

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Core | Total tests, time spent, characters typed |
| Journey | Improvement over time, best month, longest streak |
| Peak Performance | All-time PB, perfect accuracy count |
| Timing | Best/worst hours, night owl vs early bird |
| Persona | Flow State, Burst Typer, Steady Eddie (via K-means) |
| Warmup | Cold start penalty, tests until peak |
| Quirks | Restart addiction level, time "wasted" |
| Accuracy | Error type breakdown, clutch factor |
| Comparison | Estimated global percentile |


## 🤖 How the ML Works

We use **K-means clustering** on three features (WPM, accuracy, consistency) to identify your typing "personas":

The algorithm finds natural groupings in *your* data, so the personas are personalized to your typing patterns. (Unspervised Learning)
